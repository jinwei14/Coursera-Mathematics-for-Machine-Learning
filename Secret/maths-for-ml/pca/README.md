# MML: PCA

This folder contains notes and solutions to the "Principal Component Analysis" course of the specialization. I did not enjoy this course as much as the previous one's. Most of the solutions present here are not complete. Furthermore, these notes do not accurately reflect the content present in the course. I will do this course again in the future and update the notes.
