# Mathematics for Machine Learning

My notes and solutions to the MML specialization offered by the Imperial College on Coursera.

### TODO

- [ ] Update markdown syntax in notes. The notes were created using BoostNote, which has a different syntax for certain elements such as code blocks, math equations, etc. The syntax should be changed so that the notes are rendered with the equations on Github.
- [ ] Update PCA course notes.
