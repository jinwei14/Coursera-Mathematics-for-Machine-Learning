# Mean 

- Some statistical properties such as mean,variance,covariance etc
- The mean is also called _expected value_
$$mean=E[X]=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nx_i}{n}$$

- If we have the mean of $n-1$ terms as $\bar{x}_{n-1}$ and we add a new term $x_*$ to the dataset, then the mean of the new dataset $D_n$ containing $n$ terms will be

$$\bar{x}_n=\bar{x}_{n-1}+\frac{1}{n}(x_*-\bar{x}_{n-1})$$
