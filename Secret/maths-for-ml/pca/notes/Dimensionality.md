# Dimensionality

- As the number of dimensions in our data increase, it becomes difficult to analyze and visualize them. Further, storage of such high dimensional data can be expensive in practice
- However, some dimensions can be expressed as a combination of other dimensions. This allows us to compress the data and store it in a more compact form.
- _Dimensionality Reduction_ exploits structure and corelation between the data and allows us to work with a more compact representation of data(ideally without loss)
- The lower dimensional representation of a higher dimensional data point is called _feature_ or _code_
