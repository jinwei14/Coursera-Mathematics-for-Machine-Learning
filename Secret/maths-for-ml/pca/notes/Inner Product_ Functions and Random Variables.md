# Inner Product: Functions and Random Variables

## Functions
- Inner product between two functions is defined as

$$<u,v> = \int_a^bu(x)v(x)dx$$

- If this integral evaluates to 0, then the functions are orthogonal


## Random Variables

- Inner product between two random variables that are uncorelated is given as

$$var[x+y]=var[x]+var[y]$$

- As variance is measured in squared terms($\sigma^2$), the above equation is similar to the _Pythagoreas Theorm_

$$c^2=a^2+b^2$$
