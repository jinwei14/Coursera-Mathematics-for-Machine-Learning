# Inner Product: Angles and Orthogonality

- We can compute the angle between two vectors as
$$cos \theta=\frac{<x,y>}{||x||\text{  }||y||}$$

- We can also find the basis vectors of a vector space

$$<b_i, b_j> =  0, i!=j$$

- If we make sure $||b_i||$ is 1 for everu $i$, then we have an _orthonormal basis vector_
